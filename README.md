# Audio Signal Features

This repository provides a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates how to extract and visualize key audio features from a given audio file. As an illustrative example, it uses *Gymnop√©die No.1* by **Erik Satie**, included in the `audio` directory.

## Extracted Features

**Time-Domain Features:**
- Waveform
- Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Energy
- Zero-Crossing Rate
- Amplitude Envelope

**Frequency-Domain Features:**
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Spectrogram
- Mel Spectrogram
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
- Band Energy Ratio
- Spectral Centroid
- Bandwidth

## Time-Domain Features
### Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Energy
**RMS Energy** measures the magnitude of the audio signal over time. It calculates the square root of the average of the squared amplitudes of the signal. This provides a sense of the overall loudness or intensity of the sound.  
  
Formula:  
```math
RMS = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x[i]^2}
```
where N is the number of samples in the segment.   

**What it tells an ML algorithm:**
- **Loudness or Energy:** RMS Energy gives a measure of the energy (loudness) in the audio signal.
- **Dynamics:** it helps register variations in loudness.

**Use cases:**
- **Music Genre Classification** (different genres of music have unique loudness dynamics)
- **Speech Recognition** (RMS might help distinguish between voiced and unvoiced sounds)
- **Emotion Detection in Speech** (some emotions have higher event of loudness e.g. excitment or anger)
- **Audio Event Detection** (detection of claps or bangs)
