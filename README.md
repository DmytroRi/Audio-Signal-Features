# Audio Signal Features

This repository provides a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates how to extract and visualize key audio features from a given audio file. As an illustrative example, it uses *Gymnop√©die No.1* by **Erik Satie**, included in the `audio` directory.

## Extracted Features

**Time-Domain Features:**
- Waveform
- Root-Mean-Square (RMS) Energy
- Zero-Crossing Rate
- Amplitude Envelope

**Frequency-Domain Features:**
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Spectrogram
- Mel Spectrogram
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
- Band Energy Ratio
- Spectral Centroid
- Bandwidth
